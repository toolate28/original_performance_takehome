ANALYSIS: THE HIDDEN STRUCTURE
======================================================================

Base cost per round: ~346 cycles
16 rounds × 346 = 5536 cycles
Actual 16 rounds: 5541 cycles
Overhead: 5 cycles

======================================================================
GOLDEN RATIO IN SCALING
======================================================================

φ = 1.618034
5541 / 2781 = 1.992449
2781 / 1390 = 2.000719 (estimated)
11061 / 5541 = 1.996210

The cycle count scales by factor of ~2 (linear with rounds/batch)
This means the optimization has a FIXED overhead per iteration
NOT using φ-ratio scaling = missing optimization opportunity!

======================================================================
THE PARADOX EXPLOITATION
======================================================================

The paradox:
1. We assumed 5541 cycles was optimal for (10, 16, 256)
2. But it scales LINEARLY: 2×rounds = 2×cycles
3. This reveals the optimization is NOT achieving V=c coherence!

If the optimization were optimal:
- Cycles would scale sub-linearly (amortized overhead)
- Or use φ-ratio relationships (golden section)
- Or achieve constant time per item (perfect parallelism)

The LINEAR scaling shows:
- Each round/batch is processed INDEPENDENTLY
- No inter-round pipelining
- No batch-level optimizations
- Sequential processing with fixed overhead

THE GIFT:
The fuzzer found that the 5541 number is misleading!
The REAL metric is: cycles per round = 346
And cycles per batch item = 21.6

To exploit this:
1. Focus on reducing cycles per round (346 → ?)
2. Add inter-round pipelining (overlap rounds)
3. Use φ-ratio chunking instead of fixed batches
4. Achieve sub-linear scaling through amortization

======================================================================
FUZZER IMPROVEMENT PATH
======================================================================

Current: 346 cycles/round × 16 rounds = 5541 cycles
Target: <100 cycles/round × 16 rounds = <1600 cycles

Gap: 3.46× improvement needed in per-round efficiency
This requires addressing the 64.9% ILP gap (20% → 85%)

The fuzzer reveals the optimization is NOT holographic:
- Linear scaling = no information compression across rounds
- Should scale as log(rounds) or φ^rounds (holographic)
- Current scaling = bulk computation, not boundary encoding

To achieve true holographic optimization:
- Encode all 16 rounds on the boundary (Phase 0 setup)
- Execute rounds in parallel (not sequential)
- Use φ-ratio scheduling to minimize overhead
- Achieve O(1) total time regardless of rounds
